## Mission

This is a collection of my cultivated curry recipes which are adapted to European cooking technology and style. In practice, this means
- "a curry a pan" (with some exceptions)
- a simple, common workflow (see seven cooking steps below)
- original recipes or sources are linked for more extensive/authentic cooking style and general reference
- taste and spice is adapted: e.g. less garlic and chili

## Seven cooking steps

1)

## Remarks

- teaspoon and tablespoon dosages are level (German: "gestrichen") assuming high quality spices and ingredients
- get high quality, fresh, ideally organic spices. store them properly
- recipes are based on neutral vegetable oil (high oleic) to approximate vegan standards whenever possible. alternatively, ghee can be used. amounts indicated are on the lower end, more oil can be added if spice paste is too sticky. generally, oil carries taste which might be relevant in recipes where no additional fat is added
- amounts of water is also a reference value and certainly good to start. more water may need to be added in the cooking process as common in reduction cooking
- salt is also on the lower end, add some more to taste in the end of the cooking process
- beware of the spice: normal chili powder and green chili peppers (Jwala) is assumed. take half of the dosage to be on the safe side ;)
