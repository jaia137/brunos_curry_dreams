**Mission**

This is a collection of my cultivated curry recipes which are adapted to European cooking technology and style. In practice, this means
- "a curry a pan" (with some exceptions)
- a simple, common workflow (see seven cooking steps below)
- taste and spice is adapted: e.g. less garlic and chili
- streamlined workflow enables easier cooking of many curries in parallel

All recipes are at least lacto-vegetarian (paneer, cream or butter in some dishes). No meat or fish recipes. Original recipes or sources are linked for more extensive/authentic cooking style and general reference.


**Seven cooking steps**

1. Prepare and fry spices. Don't burn them, watch carefully.
2. Add onion and fry until golden. Some recipes might want to conserve the taste of fresh onions so not much frying is needed then.
3. Add garlic, chili peppers, further spices and quickly fry them.
4. Make spice paste - not a "grinded" paste unless indicated. Simply finish steps 1-3 by collecting all elements before proceeding with the actual cooking. This "paste" could also be conserved for later or mobile curry action.
5. Add water, tomatoes, coconut milk etc. to start the cooking phase. In the case of tomato base, this may take a while and builds the fundamental taste of the sauce.
6. Add "main" ingredient like lentils, beans or vegetables. Cook them until done. They may also be cooked separately, as in many original recipes. Still, make sure to simmer these ingredients for some minutes in any scenario.
7. This is the phase of final touches: herbs (cilantro, fenugreek leaves), cream and butter or alternatives, salt to taste, lemon juice, or paneer etc. will be added here. Stir it up well for a last time and taste it to perfection.

**Remarks**

- Teaspoon (tsp) and tablespoon (tbsp) dosages are level (German: "gestrichen") assuming high quality spices and ingredients. 
- High quality, fresh, ideally organic spices are recommended. Store them properly. This is obviously also true for any other ingredient.
- Recipes are based on neutral vegetable oil (high oleic) to approximate vegan standards whenever possible. Alternatively, ghee can be used. Amounts indicated are on the lower end, more oil can be added if spice paste is too sticky. Generally, oil carries taste which might be relevant in recipes where no additional fat is added.
- Amounts of water are also reference values and certainly good to start. More water may need to be added in the cooking process as common in reduction cooking.
- Salt dosage is also on the lower end, add some more to taste at the end of the cooking process if needed. Salt can be added at any step of the cooking process.
- Beware of the spice: normal strength chili powder and green chili peppers (Jwala) are assumed. Take half of the dosage if you want to be on the safe side ;)
- Vegan recipes can be filtered with the respective tag. Vegan options are listed in the vegetarian recipes. 
- Most of the curries need some time after cooking to develop the intended or favourable taste. Not much can be done here except waiting and not serving the dishes too hot.
- Always serve with fresh cilantro. Lemons and raita can help to defuse spiciness or generally reset your tongue
- A rice cooker is a wonderful machine.
