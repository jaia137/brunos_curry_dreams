**Mission**

This is a collection of my cultivated curry recipes which are adapted to European/Swiss cooking technology and style. In practice, this means
- "a curry a pan" (with some exceptions)
- a simple, streamlined, common workflow (see "seven cooking steps" below)
- workflow enables easier cooking of many curries in parallel
- taste and spice are adapted: e.g. less garlic and chili

All recipes are at least lacto-vegetarian (paneer, cream and/or butter in some dishes). No meat or fish recipes. A vegan version is always provided. Original recipes or sources are linked for more extensive/authentic cooking style and/or general reference.


**Seven cooking steps**

1. Heat oil, add onion and fry until golden.
2. Prepare and fry whole spices (including cumin seeds). Do not burn them, watch carefully. 
3. Add garlic, chili, and powder spices and quickly fry them. Do not burn them, watch carefully. 
4. Make spice paste - not a "grinded" paste unless indicated. This "paste" could also be conserved for later and/or mobile curry action. Not a "real" cooking step, but it helps to reach 7 cooking steps ;).
5. Add sauce base ingredient, like water, tomatoes, coconut milk etc. to start the sauce cooking phase. In the case of tomato base, it may take a while to build the fundamental taste of the sauce ("sugo style").
6. Add "main" ingredient like lentils, beans or vegetables. Cook them until done. They may also be cooked separately, as in many original recipes. In any case, make sure to simmer these ingredients for some minutes in any scenario.
7. This is the phase of final touches: herbs (cilantro, fenugreek leaves), cream and/or butter or alternatives, salt to taste, lemon juice, and/or paneer etc. will be added here. Stir it up well for a last time and taste it to perfection.

**Remarks**

- Teaspoon (tsp) and tablespoon (tbsp) dosages are level assuming high quality spices and ingredients. 
- Recipes are based on neutral vegetable oil (high oleic) to approximate vegan standards. Alternatively, ghee can be used. Amounts indicated are on the lower end, more oil can be added if the spice paste including onions is too sticky or dry. 
- Amounts of water are also reference values and certainly good to start with. More water may need to be added in the cooking process as common in reduction cooking.
- Salt dosage is on the lower end, add some more to taste at the end of the cooking process.
- Beware of the spice: normal strength chili powder and green chili (Jwala) are assumed. Take half of the dosage if you want to be on the safe side :P.
- Ginger is usually grated (sharp grater) and garlic crushed for convenient cooking procedures. Ginger stripes/sticks can be added for highlights.
- Taste and potency of fresh ginger are variable in Europe. Ginger powder can be an additive or an alternative.
- Tomatoes can be fresh or canned/bottled, chopped or crushed. Some recipes profit from certain forms. Generally, fresh tomatoes produce a more neutral sauce while tomato paste boosts tomato taste in some recipes.
- Full vegan recipes can be filtered via tags. Vegan options are indicated in all recipes. 
- Most of the curries profit in taste from rest after cooking. They can be safely stored an consumed in the fridge for 3-4 days.
- Always serve with fresh cilantro if recipe says so.
- Lemons and raita can help to defuse spiciness or generally reset your tongue.
- A rice cooker is a wonderful machine.
