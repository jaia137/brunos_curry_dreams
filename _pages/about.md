**Mission**

This is a collection of my cultivated curry recipes which are adapted to European cooking technology and style. In practice, this means
- "a curry a pan" (with some exceptions)
- a simple, common workflow (see "seven cooking steps" below)
- streamlined workflow enables easier cooking of many curries in parallel
- taste and spice are adapted: e.g. less garlic and chili

All recipes are at least lacto-vegetarian (paneer, cream or butter in some dishes). No meat or fish recipes. Original recipes or sources are linked for more extensive/authentic cooking style and general reference.


**Seven cooking steps**

1. Prepare and fry spices. Do not burn them, watch carefully.
2. Add onion and fry until golden.
3. Add garlic, chili peppers, and quickly fry them.
4. Make spice paste - not a "grinded" paste unless indicated. This "paste" could also be conserved for later and/or mobile curry action. Not a "real" cooking step, but nice to make it up to 7.
5. Add water, tomatoes, coconut milk etc. to start the cooking phase. In the case of tomato base, it may take a while to build the fundamental taste of the sauce ("sugo style").
6. Add "main" ingredient like lentils, beans or vegetables. Cook them until done. They may also be cooked separately, as in many original recipes. In any case, make sure to simmer these ingredients for some minutes in any scenario.
7. This is the phase of final touches: herbs (cilantro, fenugreek leaves), cream and butter or alternatives, salt to taste, lemon juice, or paneer etc. will be added here. Stir it up well for a last time and taste it to perfection.

**Remarks**

- Teaspoon (tsp) and tablespoon (tbsp) dosages are level assuming high quality spices and ingredients. 
- Recipes are based on neutral vegetable oil (high oleic) to approximate vegan standards. Alternatively, ghee can be used. Amounts indicated are on the lower end, more oil can be added if spice paste including onions is too sticky. 
- Amounts of water are also reference values and certainly good to start with. More water may need to be added in the cooking process as common in reduction cooking.
- Salt dosage is on the lower end, add some more to taste at the end of the cooking process if needed.
- Beware of the spice: normal strength chili powder and green chili peppers (Jwala) are assumed. Take half of the dosage if you want to be on the safe side.
- Ginger is usually grated (sharp grater) and garlic crushed for convenient cooking procedures. Ginger stripes/sticks can be added for highlights.
- Taste and potency of fresh ginger are variable in Europe. Ginger powder can be an additive or an alternative.
- Tomatoes can be fresh or canned/bottled, chopped or crushed. Some recipes profit from certain forms. Generally, fresh tomatoes produce a more neutral sauce while tomato paste boosts tomato taste in some recipes.
- Vegan recipes can be filtered via tags. Vegan options are furthermore indicated in all recipes. 
- Most of the curries profit in taste from rest after cooking.
- Always serve with fresh cilantro. 
- Lemons and raita can help to defuse spiciness or generally reset your tongue.
- A rice cooker is a wonderful machine.
